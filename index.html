    <h3>Who is Enrico?</h3>
    <p>I had 2 startups myself, after working in the corporate world for a while. I like to spend my time being productive and collaborating in the creation of products that people use and love: I'd rather do that than become an expert in corporate politics.
  I like ambiguity because it uncovers opportunities and I like to make decisions and learn from mistakes.....this is a startup in "growth mode".
  I have an eye that spots inefficiencies. When I see one, I must fix it and I usually get several ideas on how to make it happen.
  Building, growing and selling innovation that improves people's lives. Investing in ideas of others.</p>
